# bitburner

This repository is for version control of the scripts I write for the game [Bitburner](https://github.com/danielyxie/bitburner), which is a free game that encourages the player to interact with use of JavaScript.
I will be primarily utilizing "NetScript 2", which is essentially just JavaScript extended with Bitburner-specific functionality.

**THIS GAME IS PURELY FOR FUN AND EDUCATION.** I do not support crimes, doing crimes, being a internet crime-er, hackering, etc. I am a good boy who enjoys coding and playing idle/clicker/iterative games.
embarassing: when setting up this repo i forgot to sign into my professional account locally on my desktop. jwin00 or whatever the username is is also my account that i really don't use anymore. you can tell we're the same person because his js is also ugly lol.
